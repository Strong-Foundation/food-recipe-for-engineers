# Food Recipe for Engineers 🍔🍕🥘

## Why Does This Exist? 🤷‍♂️

My family went on vacation and left me to fend for myself. Instead of surviving on instant noodles and existential dread, I decided to document some actually good recipes that even an engineer (like me) can follow. If I can make these, so can you!

## What’s Inside? 📜

A collection of **foolproof** (read: mostly idiot-proof) recipes that require minimal effort but deliver maximum taste. Whether you're a coding wizard or a terminal junkie, this guide will help you whip up solid meals without bricking your kitchen.

## Featured Recipes 🍽️

- **Halal Guys-Style Chicken Over Rice** 🐔🍚
- More coming soon (or whenever I get hungry enough to write them down)!

## How to Use 🛠️

1. Clone this repo (because why not version control your food?):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-recipe-for-engineers.git
   cd food-recipe-for-engineers
   ```
2. Pick a recipe and follow the instructions (seriously, don’t improvise like you do with your code).
3. Cook, eat, and enjoy the fact that you didn't have to order takeout for the 10th time this week.

Do whatever you want with this. Just don’t blame me if your fire alarm goes off.
