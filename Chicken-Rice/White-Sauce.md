### **Pro Tips for the Perfect White Sauce:**

âœ” **Use full-fat mayo & Greek yogurt** â€“ This makes the sauce creamy and thick.  
âœ” **Let it rest** â€“ The flavors need time to blend. Overnight in the fridge makes it even better.  
âœ” **Adjust consistency** â€“ Use milk for a richer, silkier texture instead of water.  
âœ” **Oregano makes a difference** â€“ It adds that subtle Mediterranean touch that takes it up a notch.  
âœ” **Pairs well with:** Chicken over rice, lamb, fries, salads, and even as a burger sauce!

### **Storage**
