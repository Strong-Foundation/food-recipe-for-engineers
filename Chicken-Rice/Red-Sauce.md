### **ðŸ”¥ Pro Tips for the Best Hot Sauce:**

âœ” **Use quality chili flakes** â€“ Gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes) or Aleppo pepper gives a more complex heat.  
âœ” **Adjust the spice** â€“ Add more cayenne if you like it crazy hot.  
âœ” **Vinegar is key** â€“ It brightens the sauce and balances the heat.  
âœ” **Resting makes it better** â€“ Let it sit in the fridge for **24 hours** before using for deeper flavor.  
âœ” **Blend it for smoothness** â€“ The original Halal Guys sauce is more of a paste.
