### **Instructions**

1. **Rinse the Rice:**

   - In a medium saucepan, melt **butter** over medium heat.
   - Add **turmeric, cumin, smoked paprika, and salt**. Stir for **30 seconds** until fragrant (this enhances the flavor).

3. **Toast the Rice:**

   - Add the **rinsed rice** to the pan and stir for about **1-2 minutes**, coating each grain with the spiced butter. This toasting step makes the rice extra flavorful.

4. **Cook the Rice:**

   - Pour in the **chicken broth (or water)** and add the **bay leaf** if using.
   - Bring to a **boil**, then reduce heat to **low**, cover, and let it simmer for **15 minutes** (or until the liquid is fully absorbed).

5. **Rest and Fluff:**
   - Turn off the heat and let the rice sit **covered** for another **5 minutes**.
   - Remove the bay leaf, then fluff with a fork.
